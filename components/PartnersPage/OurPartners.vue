      The European Commission and its 27 Member States provide about 46% of the world's 
      official development assistance, which makes them the world's largest donor with 
      a total of â‚¬66.8 billion allocated in 2020. The EU is therefore a key player 
      in the attainment of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 
      To achieve its objectives, the European Commission is mobilizing its European partners. 
      For more than 12 years, AFD Group has been working extensively with the EU.
